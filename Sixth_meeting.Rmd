## Ableism and positive psychology
<br>
In this meeting, the anti-discrimination working group covered ableism, disablism, and positive psychology.
<br>

### What is ableism?
<br>
Using the definition presented <a href="https://www.accessliving.org/newsroom/blog/ableism-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Access living - Ableism 101">here</a>: 
<br><br>
_Ableism_ is the __discrimination__ of and __social prejudice__ against people with disabilities based on the belief that __typical abilities__ are __superior__. At its heart, ableism is rooted in the __assumption__ that disabled people require __'fixing'__ and defines people by their disability. Like racism and sexism, ableism classifies entire groups of people as __'less than'__, and includes harmful stereotypes, misconceptions, and generalizations of people with disabilities.
<br><br>

### What is disablism?
<br>
Using the definition given <a href="https://www.sense.org.uk/information-and-advice/ableism-and-disablism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Sense - Ableism and disablism">here</a>: 
<br><br>
_Disablism_ is a word for __negative__ opinions, behaviour, or abuse against disabled people. You are being disablist if you __treat someone differently__, or choose to __offend__ or __hurt__ someone, because of their disability.

<br><br>

### What is the difference between ableism and disablism?
<br>
There is some overlap between _ableism_ and _disablism_, and many people use these two words interchangeably. In general, _ableism_ can be used to describe the way society and people tend to favor able-bodied people, while _disablism_ can be used to describe more direct and conscious acts of discrimination or abuse against people with disabilities. 
<br>
_Disablism_ is a newer word, and it is preferred by some activists because they believe that the word _disablism_ makes it clearer that it has nothing to do with the disabled individual's 'ability'.
