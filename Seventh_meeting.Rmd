Using the definition presented in the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0529-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="A diverse view of science to catalyse change">_A diverse view of science to catalyse change_</a> by Urbina-Blanco et al. : 
<br><br>
The ways in which people differ, encompassing all the characteristics that make one individual or group distinctive. The dimensions of diversity include, but are not limited to
