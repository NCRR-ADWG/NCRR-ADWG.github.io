## Who are we? 
<br>
We are psychiatric genetics researchers at Aarhus University, based at the
<a href="https://clin.au.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Department of Clinical Medicine">Department of Clinical Medicine</a> and 
<a href="https://ncrr.au.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The National Centre for Register-based Research">the National Centre for Register-based Research (NCRR)</a>. We started an Anti-Discrimination Working Group in the spring of 2023 to discuss issues related to discrimination and bias in human genetics and psychiatry research. The aim is to be better informed and more inclusive in our research.
<br><br><br>
 
## What are our aims?
<br>
We were inspired by the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/mental-health-and-psychological-sciences/about/departments/social-genetic-and-developmental-psychiatry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London">Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre</a>â€™s Anti-Racism Working Group at King's College London. Based on the goals of their group, we defined the following aims:

* To strive for **equality**
* To strive for **diversity**
* To be **open** and **transparent**
* To be mindful that **the topics we discuss may be triggering and upsetting**, impacting on people in different ways.  

<space><space><space><space><font size = 3>This is not a passive intellectual topic. It takes time to install the correct support and find solutions. **This is a learning process**</font>

* To discuss ongoing issues with **discrimination in research**
* To recognize **harmful structures and practices** of discrimination in research
* To **advocate for changes** that promote equality in research
