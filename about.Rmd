## Who are we? 
<br>
We are psychiatric genetics researchers at Aarhus University, based at the Department of Clinical Medicine and the National Centre for Register-based Research. We have recently started an Anti-Discrimination Working Group in order to discuss issues related to discrimination and bias in genetics research. The aim is to be better informed and more inclusive in our research.

Our aims are 

* To strive for **equality**
* To strive for **diversity**
* To be **open** and **transparent**
* To be mindful that **the topics we discuss may be triggering and upsetting**, impacting on people in different ways.
    + This is not a passive intellectual topic. It takes time to install the correct support and find solutions. **This is a learning process**

* To recognize **harmful structures and practices** of discrimination in research
* To **advocate for changes** that promote equality in research
